# Windows XP App for Home Assistant

This app allows you to run a Windows XP environment inside Home Assistant using [Dockur Windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows) with noVNC access.

## Features

- Windows-in-Docker with QEMU
- Web-based access via Home Assistant Ingress (noVNC)

## Requirements

- AMD64 Based System
- Home Assistant Operating System
- 10GB Free Space (Dedicated)

## Installation

Open the app and then click install. 
It is recommended that you turn off protected mode before starting the app.

## Usage

- Open from the Home Assistant App panel
- Or access externally at `http://<HA-IP>:8006/vnc.html` (if ingress is disabled)

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure VT-x (Virtualization) is enabled in the BIOS
- Ensure that you are using an AMD64 based system
- ARCH64 based systems are not supported (e.g. raspberry pi)
- If running HAOS inside Proxmox, ensure CPU is set to Host, and the AES flag is ON
